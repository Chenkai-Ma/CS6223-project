1. The output cliques must be subsets of the input graph's nodes, ensuring that all nodes in each returned clique are present in the original graph.

2. Each returned clique must be a complete subgraph, meaning that every pair of nodes within the clique must be directly connected by an edge in the graph.

3. The function should yield all maximal cliques, meaning no additional nodes can be added to any returned clique without breaking its completeness.

4. If the input graph is empty, the function should yield no cliques, returning an empty output.

5. If specific nodes are provided as input, the function should only yield cliques that include those nodes, and it should raise an error if the provided nodes do not form a clique.
