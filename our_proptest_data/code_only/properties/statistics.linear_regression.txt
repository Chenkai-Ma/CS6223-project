1. The slope of the linear regression output should be equal to zero when all input `y` values are constant (regardless of the `x` values provided).

2. The intercept of the linear regression output should equal the mean of the `y` values when the `proportional` flag is set to `False` and the slope is zero.

3. The output of the linear regression should produce a valid `LinearRegression` object containing numeric values for both slope and intercept.

4. The slope of the linear regression output should change continuously as the input data points are varied, assuming the relationship between `x` and `y` is linear.

5. When the number of data points `n` is less than 2, the function should raise a `StatisticsError`, ensuring that the function enforces the requirement for a minimum number of data points.
