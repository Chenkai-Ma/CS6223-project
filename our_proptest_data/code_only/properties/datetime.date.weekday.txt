1. The output of the `weekday` function should always be an integer between 0 and 6, inclusive.
2. The output value should represent the correct day of the week, where 0 corresponds to Monday and 6 corresponds to Sunday.
3. The result of the `weekday` function should be consistent for the same date input, meaning that calling the function multiple times with the same date should yield the same result.
4. The output should change predictably when the input date changes, specifically advancing by 1 for each day increment in the input.
5. The output should exhibit periodicity, such that the `weekday` function returns the same value for dates that are exactly one week apart.
