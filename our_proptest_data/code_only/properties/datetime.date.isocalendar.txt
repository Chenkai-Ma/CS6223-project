1. The output year should be equal to the input year if the date falls within the first week of the year; otherwise, it should reflect the correct ISO year based on the week calculation.

2. The output week should always be in the range of 1 to 53, inclusive, as per ISO week date standards.

3. The output day should always be in the range of 1 to 7, corresponding to Monday through Sunday.

4. For any given date, if the output week is 1, then the output year should be the same as the input year or one less if the date falls before the first Monday of the year.

5. If the input date is the last day of the year (December 31), the output week should either be the last week of the year or the first week of the following year, depending on whether it falls before or after the first Monday of the new year.
