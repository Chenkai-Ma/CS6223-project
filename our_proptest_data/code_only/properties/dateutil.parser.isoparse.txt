1. The output should always be a valid `datetime` object representing the parsed ISO date and time from the input string.

2. If the input string represents a date and time that is exactly "24:00", the output should represent the next day at "00:00".

3. The output `datetime` object should have the same year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values as specified in the input string, barring any adjustments for the "24:00" case.

4. The function should raise a `ValueError` if the input string contains unknown ISO components, ensuring that the output is only produced for valid ISO 8601 formats.

5. The output should maintain the timezone information if the input string includes a timezone offset, ensuring that the `datetime` object accurately reflects the specified timezone.
