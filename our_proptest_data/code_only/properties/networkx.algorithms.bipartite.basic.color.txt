1. The output dictionary should contain exactly two distinct colors (0 and 1) for all nodes in a bipartite graph, ensuring that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

2. If the input graph is empty, the output should also be an empty dictionary, indicating that there are no nodes to color.

3. For any isolated nodes in the input graph, the output should assign them the color 0, as they are not connected to any other nodes.

4. The output should maintain a one-to-one mapping between nodes in the input graph and the keys in the output dictionary, meaning every node in the graph should have a corresponding entry in the color dictionary.

5. If the input graph is not bipartite, the function should raise a `NetworkXError`, indicating that it cannot assign colors without violating the bipartite condition.
