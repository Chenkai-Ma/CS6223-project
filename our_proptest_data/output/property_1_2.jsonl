{"function_name": "statistics_variance", "properties": ["1. The output variance should always be a non-negative number, as variance cannot be negative due to the squaring of differences from the mean.\n\n2.

The output variance should change in a predictable manner when the input data is modified, such as adding or removing values, particularly when those values are far from the mean.\n\n4. If the mean of the input data is provided as the second argument, the output variance should remain consistent with the variance calculated using the automatically computed mean, provided that the correct mean is used.\n\n5. The output variance should be larger when the spread of the input data increases, and smaller when the spread decreases, reflecting the relationship between data dispersion and variance.", "1. The output variance value is always non-negative, as variance cannot be less than zero.\n2. If all input data points are identical, the output variance should be zero, indicating no variability.\n3. The output variance increases as the spread of the input data increases, meaning larger differences between data points should result in a larger variance.\n4. If the mean of the input data is constant (the same for different datasets), the output variance should remain consistent across those datasets with the same spread.\n5. The output variance is sensitive to outliers; the presence of extreme values in the input data should lead to an increase in the calculated variance.", "1. The variance output must be non-negative, as variance cannot be negative regardless of the input data.\n2. If all input data points are identical, the variance should be zero, indicating no spread in the data.\n3. The variance of an empty list or a list with fewer than two values should raise a StatisticsError.\n4. If the input data is a sample of a population, the output variance should approximate the true population variance when the sample size is sufficiently large.\n5. The variance calculated with the provided mean (xbar) should yield the same result as the variance calculated with the mean derived from the data, provided the correct mean is used.", "1. The variance output is always non-negative, as it represents a measure of dispersion and cannot be less than zero.\n\n2. When the input data contains only identical values, the variance should be zero, indicating no variability in the data.\n\n3. If the variance is calculated using the mean provided as the second argument (xbar) and it matches the actual mean of the input data, the output should remain consistent with the variance calculated without the xbar argument.\n\n4. The variance for any given dataset should be the same regardless of the order of the elements in the dataset, as variance is a property of the distribution rather than the arrangement of data points.\n\n5. The output of the variance calculation should be sensitive to changes in the dataset; specifically, adding or removing data points should result in a change in the variance value, reflecting the new spread of the data.", "1. The variance output is always non-negative, as it represents a measure of dispersion and cannot be less than zero.\n\n2. If all input values are identical, the variance should be zero, indicating no variability in the data.\n\n3. The variance of a larger dataset (with more data points) should either remain the same or increase when new points are added, assuming the new points are not identical to the existing ones.\n\n4. The variance calculated using the mean provided as the second argument (xbar) should yield the same result as the variance calculated without it, provided that the mean is accurate and correctly reflects the data.\n\n5.

Variance, or second moment about the mean, is a measure of the variability (spread or dispersion) of data. A large variance indicates that the data is spread out; a small variance indicates it is clustered closely around the mean.\n\nIf the optional second argument xbar is given, it should be the mean of data. If it is missing or None (the default), the mean is automatically calculated.\n\nUse this function when your data is a sample from a population. To calculate the variance from the entire population, see pvariance().\n\nRaises StatisticsError if data has fewer than two values.\n\nExamples:\n\n>>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5]\n>>> variance(data)\n1.3720238095238095\nIf you have already calculated the mean of your data, you can pass it as the optional second argument xbar to avoid recalculation:\n\n>>> m = mean(data)\n>>> variance(data, m)\n1.3720238095238095\nThis function does not attempt to verify that you have passed the actual mean as xbar. Using arbitrary values for xbar can lead to invalid or impossible results.\n\nDecimal and Fraction values are supported:\n\n>>> from decimal import Decimal as D\n>>> variance([D(\"27.5\"), D(\"30.25\"), D(\"30.25\"), D(\"34.5\"), D(\"41.75\")])\nDecimal('31.01875')\n\n>>> from fractions import Fraction as F\n>>> variance([F(1, 6), F(1, 2), F(5, 3)])\nFraction(67, 108)\nNote This is the sample variance s\u00b2 with Bessel\u2019s correction, also known as variance with N-1 degrees of freedom. Provided that the data points are representative (e.g. independent and identically distributed), the result should be an unbiased estimate of the true population variance.\nIf you somehow know the actual population mean \u03bc you should pass it to the pvariance() function as the mu parameter to get the variance of a sample."}
