If the input data contains only identical values, the output variance should be zero, indicating no dispersion.\n\n3. The output variance should increase if the spread of the input data increases while keeping the mean constant.\n\n4. The output variance should be invariant to the addition of a constant value to all data points; that is, adding the same constant to each data point should not change the variance.\n\n5. If the mean of the input data is provided as `xbar`, the output variance should remain consistent with the variance calculated using the automatically computed mean, provided that the mean is correctly calculated.", "1. The output variance value is always non-negative, as variance cannot be less than zero.\n2. If all input data points are identical, the output variance should be zero, indicating no variability.\n3. The output variance increases as the spread of the input data increases, meaning larger differences between data points should result in a larger variance.\n4. If the mean of the input data is constant (the same for different datasets), the output variance should remain consistent across those datasets with the same spread.\n5. The output variance is sensitive to the number of input data points, meaning that increasing the number of samples while keeping the spread constant will generally lead to a more reliable estimate of variance.", "1. The variance output must be non-negative, as variance cannot be negative regardless of the input data.\n2. If all input data points are identical, the variance should be zero, indicating no spread in the data.\n3. The variance of an empty list or a list with fewer than two values should raise a StatisticsError.\n4. If the input data is a sample of a population, the output variance should approximate the true population variance when the sample is sufficiently large and representative.\n5. The variance output should change continuously as the input data points are varied, meaning small changes in the input should lead to small changes in the output variance.", "1. The variance output is always non-negative, as it represents a measure of dispersion and is calculated as the average of squared deviations from the mean.\n\n2. If all input data points are identical, the variance output should be zero, indicating no variability in the data.\n\n3. The variance output increases as the spread of the input data increases, meaning that if the values in the input data are further apart from the mean, the variance should also be larger.\n\n4. When the input data contains only two identical values, the variance should be zero, demonstrating that there\u2019s no variability in the sample.\n\n5. The variance calculated using the optional mean parameter (xbar) should yield the same result as when the mean is computed within the function, as long as xbar is the correct mean of the input data.", "1. The variance output is always non-negative, as it represents a measure of dispersion and cannot be less than zero.\n\n2. If all input values are identical, the variance should be zero, indicating no variability in the data.\n\n3. The variance of a larger dataset (with more data points) should either remain the same or increase when new points are added, assuming the new points are not identical to the existing ones.\n\n4. The variance calculated using the mean provided as the second argument (xbar) should yield the same result as the variance calculated by the function if the mean is accurately computed from the data.\n\n5. The variance should change consistently with alterations to the input data: for instance, if the input data is scaled (multiplied by a constant factor), the variance should scale by the square of that factor."], "api_doc": "statistics.variance(data, xbar=None)\nReturn the sample variance of data, an iterable of at least two real-valued numbers. Variance, or second moment about the mean, is a measure of the variability (spread or dispersion) of data. A large variance indicates that the data is spread out; a small variance indicates it is clustered closely around the mean.\n\nIf the optional second argument xbar is given, it should be the mean of data. If it is missing or None (the default), the mean is automatically calculated.\n\nUse this function when your data is a sample from a population. To calculate the variance from the entire population, see pvariance().\n\nRaises StatisticsError if data has fewer than two values.\n\nExamples:\n\n>>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5]\n>>> variance(data)\n1.3720238095238095\nIf you have already calculated the mean of your data, you can pass it as the optional second argument xbar to avoid recalculation:\n\n>>> m = mean(data)\n>>> variance(data, m)\n1.3720238095238095\nThis function does not attempt to verify that you have passed the actual mean as xbar. Using arbitrary values for xbar can lead to invalid or impossible results.\n\nDecimal and Fraction values are supported:\n\n>>> from decimal import Decimal as D\n>>> variance([D(\"27.5\"), D(\"30.25\"), D(\"30.25\"), D(\"34.5\"), D(\"41.75\")])\nDecimal('31.01875')\n\n>>> from fractions import Fraction as F\n>>> variance([F(1, 6), F(1, 2), F(5, 3)])\nFraction(67, 108)\nNote This is the sample variance s\u00b2 with Bessel\u2019s correction, also known as variance with N-1 degrees of freedom. Provided that the data points are representative (e.g. independent and identically distributed), the result should be an unbiased estimate of the true population variance.\nIf you somehow know the actual population mean \u03bc you should pass it to the pvariance() function as the mu parameter to get the variance of a sample."}
