1. The norm of a vector is always non-negative, and it is zero if and only if the vector is the zero vector.

2. The norm of a matrix is non-negative, and it is zero if and only if the matrix is the zero matrix.

3. The Frobenius norm of a matrix should be equal to the 2-norm of the matrix when calculated on a flattened version of the matrix.

4. The result of the norm function should be invariant under scalar multiplication of the input (i.e., scaling the input by a constant should scale the norm by the absolute value of that constant).

5. The norm computed along a specific axis should be consistent with the properties of norms, such that the overall norm of the array should equal the computed norms when aggregated appropriately along the specified axes.
