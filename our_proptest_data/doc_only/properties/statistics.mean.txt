1. The mean of a non-empty dataset must always be a number (integer, float, Fraction, or Decimal) and cannot be NaN or infinite.

2. The mean of a dataset containing identical values must equal that value (e.g., mean([5, 5, 5]) should return 5).

3. The mean of a dataset that includes negative numbers must still yield a valid number, which could be negative or positive, depending on the values in the dataset.

4. The mean of an empty dataset must raise a StatisticsError, ensuring that the function properly handles edge cases.

5. The mean of a dataset must be within the range of the minimum and maximum values of that dataset (i.e., mean(data) should be ≥ min(data) and ≤ max(data)).
