1. The output should be equal to the sum of the product of the first two arguments and the third argument, i.e., `self * other + third`.

2. The output should be a `Decimal` type, ensuring the result maintains the precision characteristics of the `Decimal` class.

3. If either `other` or `third` is zero, the output should equal `self + third` (if `other` is 0) or `self * other` (if `third` is 0).

4. The output should be consistent with the commutative property of addition, meaning `fma(other, third)` should yield the same result as `fma(third, other)` when the roles of the second and third arguments are swapped.

5. The output should not be affected by the rounding mode of the context, as the operation is designed to perform the multiplication without rounding the intermediate product.
