1. The output dictionary should contain an entry for each node specified in the `nodes` parameter (or all nodes in the graph if `nodes` is not provided), with the node as the key.

2. The average degree values in the output dictionary should be non-negative numbers, as degrees cannot be negative.

3. For undirected graphs, the average neighbor degree should be symmetric, meaning that the average neighbor degree of node A should equal that of node B if A and B are neighbors.

4. If the graph is directed and the source is set to "in", the average neighbor degree for nodes with no predecessors should be zero.

5. The average neighbor degree should be consistent when called multiple times with the same parameters, returning the same results for the same graph structure and parameters.
