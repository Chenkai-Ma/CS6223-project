1. The total number of seconds returned by `total_seconds()` should always be a non-negative float, as it represents a duration.
2. The total number of seconds should be equal to the sum of the individual components of the `timedelta` object, converted into seconds.
3. The total number of seconds should remain consistent regardless of the input representation (e.g., using days, weeks, hours, etc.) as long as the total duration is the same.
4. For very large time intervals (greater than 270 years), the total number of seconds may lose microsecond accuracy, meaning the output may not accurately reflect the true duration.
5. The total number of seconds should be zero if the `timedelta` object represents a duration of zero (i.e., all components are zero).
