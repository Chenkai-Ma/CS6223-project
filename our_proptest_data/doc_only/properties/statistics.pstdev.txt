1. The output of the function is always a non-negative number, as standard deviation cannot be negative.
2. If the input data is a constant list (all elements are the same), the output should be zero, indicating no variability.
3. The output should increase if the variability of the input data increases (i.e., if the range of the input data expands).
4. The output should remain the same if the input list is modified by adding or removing elements that do not change the overall variance (e.g., adding a constant value to all elements).
5. The output should be equal to the square root of the output from the `pvariance()` function when the same input data is provided.
