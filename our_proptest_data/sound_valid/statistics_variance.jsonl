Variance, or second moment about the mean, is a measure of the variability (spread or dispersion) of data. A large variance indicates that the data is spread out; a small variance indicates it is clustered closely around the mean.\n\nIf the optional second argument xbar is given, it should be the mean of data. If it is missing or None (the default), the mean is automatically calculated.\n\nUse this function when your data is a sample from a population. To calculate the variance from the entire population, see pvariance().\n\nRaises StatisticsError if data has fewer than two values.\n\nExamples:\n\n>>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5]\n>>> variance(data)\n1.3720238095238095\nIf you have already calculated the mean of your data, you can pass it as the optional second argument xbar to avoid recalculation:\n\n>>> m = mean(data)\n>>> variance(data, m)\n1.3720238095238095\nThis function does not attempt to verify that you have passed the actual mean as xbar. Using arbitrary values for xbar can lead to invalid or impossible results.\n\nDecimal and Fraction values are supported:\n\n>>> from decimal import Decimal as D\n>>> variance([D(\"27.5\"), D(\"30.25\"), D(\"30.25\"), D(\"34.5\"), D(\"41.75\")])\nDecimal('31.01875')\n\n>>> from fractions import Fraction as F\n>>> variance([F(1, 6), F(1, 2), F(5, 3)])\nFraction(67, 108)\nNote This is the sample variance s\u00b2 with Bessel\u2019s correction, also known as variance with N-1 degrees of freedom. Provided that the data points are representative (e.g. independent and identically distributed), the result should be an unbiased estimate of the true population variance.\nIf you somehow know the actual population mean \u03bc you should pass it to the pvariance() function as the mu parameter to get the variance of a sample."}
