classmethod datetime.combine(date, time, tzinfo=time.tzinfo)
Return a new datetime object whose date components are equal to the given date object’s, and whose time components are equal to the given time object’s. If the tzinfo argument is provided, its value is used to set the tzinfo attribute of the result, otherwise the tzinfo attribute of the time argument is used. If the date argument is a datetime object, its time components and tzinfo attributes are ignored.

For any datetime object d, d == datetime.combine(d.date(), d.time(), d.tzinfo).

Changed in version 3.6: Added the tzinfo argument.
