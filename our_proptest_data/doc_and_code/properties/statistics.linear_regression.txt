1. The slope of the linear regression line should be a float and represent the rate of change of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable.

2. The intercept of the linear regression line should be a float and represent the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero (or zero when proportional is true).

3. If both input lists have the same values (e.g., x = [1, 2, 3] and y = [1, 2, 3]), the slope should be equal to 1 and the intercept should be 0 (or undefined when proportional is true).

4. If the input lists contain a constant value for the independent variable x (e.g., x = [5, 5, 5]), a StatisticsError should be raised, indicating that x cannot be constant.

5. The output should handle input lists of varying lengths and should raise a StatisticsError if the lengths are not equal or if they contain fewer than two data points.
