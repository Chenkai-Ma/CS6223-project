1. The output is a subset of the nodes in the input graph \( G \).

2. The output set is a dominating set, meaning that every node in the graph \( G \) is either included in the output set or is adjacent to at least one node in the output set.

3. If the weight attribute is provided, the sum of the weights of the nodes in the output set does not exceed \( \log(w(V)) \times w(V^*) \), where \( w(V) \) is the total weight of all nodes in \( G \) and \( w(V^*) \) is the weight of the minimum weight dominating set.

4. If no weight attribute is specified, the output set still qualifies as a dominating set, and the sum of the weights is equal to the number of nodes in the output set, as each node is assumed to have a weight of one.

5. The function raises a `NetworkXNotImplemented` exception if the input graph \( G \) is directed, indicating that the output is only valid for undirected graphs.
