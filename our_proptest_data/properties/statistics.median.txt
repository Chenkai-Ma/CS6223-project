1. The median of a non-empty list of numbers should always be a number (either an integer or a float).

2. If the input list has an odd number of elements, the median should be equal to the middle element when the list is sorted.

3. If the input list has an even number of elements, the median should be the average of the two middle elements when the list is sorted.

4. The median should remain unchanged if the input list is sorted in ascending or descending order.

5. The median should raise a StatisticsError when the input list is empty.
