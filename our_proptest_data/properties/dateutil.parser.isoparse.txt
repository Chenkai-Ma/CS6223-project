1. The output datetime object should represent the same date and time as specified in the input ISO-8601 string, with all components correctly parsed (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and timezone).

2. If the input ISO-8601 string specifies a timezone offset, the output datetime object should reflect the correct UTC time, adjusted according to the given offset.

3. The output datetime object should default to the minimum values for any unspecified components (e.g., if only the year is provided, the month and day should default to January 1st).

4. The output should correctly handle both representations of midnight (00:00 and 24:00) and interpret them as equivalent to the start of the day.

5. The output should raise an appropriate error for invalid ISO-8601 strings, ensuring that valid strings continue to be parsed correctly while invalid ones do not produce ambiguous results.
