1. Shifting a positive integer to the left by a non-negative integer results in a number that is greater than or equal to the original number, assuming no overflow occurs.

2. Shifting a positive integer to the right by a positive integer results in a number that is less than or equal to the original number, assuming the shift does not exceed the number of digits in the integer.

3. Shifting a negative integer to the left by a non-negative integer results in a number that is less than or equal to the original number, assuming no overflow occurs.

4. Shifting a negative integer to the right by a positive integer results in a number that is greater than or equal to the original number, assuming the shift does not exceed the number of digits in the integer.

5. The output of the shift operation should always have the same sign and exponent as the first operand, regardless of the shifting amount.
