1. If a cycle is found, the output must contain at least one edge, indicating that a cyclic path exists in the graph.

2. The edges in the output cycle must form a closed loop, meaning the head of the last edge must connect back to the tail of the first edge in the cycle.

3. For directed graphs, the output edges must respect the specified orientation; if the orientation is 'original', 'reverse', or 'ignore', the traversal direction indicated in the output must align with the chosen orientation.

4. If the input graph is acyclic (i.e., a Directed Acyclic Graph), the function must raise a `NetworkXNoCycle` exception, confirming that no cycle exists.

5. The output must accurately represent the edges traversed during the depth-first search, including the correct order of edges as determined by the traversal process.
