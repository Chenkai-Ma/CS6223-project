1. The output of `fma` should be equal to the sum of the product of `self` and `other` and `third`, specifically `self * other + third`, without any intermediate rounding errors.

2. If either `self` or `other` is a special value (like NaN or Infinity), the output should conform to the rules of arithmetic for those special values, returning appropriate results or raising errors as defined.

3. The output should maintain the same sign as the product of `self` and `other`, unless one of the inputs is zero, in which case the output should equal `third`.

4. The function should consistently handle edge cases, such as multiplying by zero, resulting in the output being equal to `third`, regardless of the values of `self` and `other`.

5. The output should be a valid `Decimal` instance, preserving the precision and scale characteristics defined by the context, and should not introduce any unexpected rounding or overflow errors.
