1. The output of the adjusted() function should be an integer representing the adjusted exponent of the Decimal instance.

2. For a Decimal instance with a coefficient of zero, the adjusted() function should return 0, regardless of the exponent.

3. The output of the adjusted() function should be greater than or equal to the exponent of the Decimal instance when the coefficient is non-zero.

4. If the Decimal instance represents a number in scientific notation, the adjusted() function should correctly account for the position of the most significant digit relative to the decimal point.

5. The adjusted() function should return 0 for any Decimal instance that is NaN or Infinity, as indicated by the handling of TypeError in the source code.
