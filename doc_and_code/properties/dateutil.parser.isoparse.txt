1. The output of the function is always a valid `datetime.datetime` object, representing a point in time that corresponds to the input ISO-8601 string.

2. If the input string represents a date without a time portion, the time components of the output `datetime` object default to midnight (00:00:00).

3. If the input string includes a time portion that specifies midnight as "24:00", the output `datetime` object should represent the next day at midnight (00:00:00).

4. The output `datetime` object should correctly reflect any provided time zone offset, converting the time to UTC if necessary.

5. The function should handle incomplete date formats gracefully, returning the earliest possible valid date for the unspecified components (e.g., for "2023-01", the output should default the day to the first of the month).
