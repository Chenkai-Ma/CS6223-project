1. If the input graph is acyclic, the output should always be False, indicating that acyclic graphs are not aperiodic.

2. If the input graph contains a single cycle of length k, where k > 1, the output should be False, as k divides the length of the cycle.

3. If the input graph has multiple cycles with lengths that are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), the output should be True, indicating that the graph is aperiodic.

4. If the input graph is empty (i.e., contains no nodes), the output should raise a NetworkXPointlessConcept error, indicating that the concept of aperiodicity does not apply.

5. If the input graph is directed but has no cycles, the output should be False, confirming that directed acyclic graphs are not aperiodic.
