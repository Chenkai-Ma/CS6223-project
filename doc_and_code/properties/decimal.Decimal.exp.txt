1. The output of the exponential function for any real number input should always be a positive Decimal value, except when the input is negative infinity or NaN.

2. The exponential function should return 1 when the input is 0.

3. The output of the exponential function should approach 0 as the input approaches negative infinity.

4. The output of the exponential function should approach positive infinity as the input approaches positive infinity.

5. The output of the exponential function for any input should be correctly rounded using the ROUND_HALF_EVEN rounding mode.
