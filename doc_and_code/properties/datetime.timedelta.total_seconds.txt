1. The total number of seconds returned by `total_seconds()` should always be non-negative for any valid `timedelta` instance, as negative durations are not represented in the context of total seconds.

2. The output of `total_seconds()` should be equal to the sum of the days, seconds, and microseconds converted to seconds, ensuring that the calculation accurately reflects the total duration represented by the `timedelta`.

3. For any `timedelta` instance representing a duration of zero (i.e., `timedelta(0)`), the output of `total_seconds()` should be exactly zero.

4. The total number of seconds returned by `total_seconds()` should be consistent across different representations of the same duration (e.g., `timedelta(days=1, seconds=86400)` should yield the same result as `timedelta(seconds=86400)`).

5. The output of `total_seconds()` should be accurate and maintain microsecond precision for durations less than or equal to 270 years, as specified in the documentation, meaning that it should not lose precision within this range.
