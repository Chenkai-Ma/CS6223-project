1. The output pair (n, d) should represent the Decimal instance as a fraction in lowest terms, meaning that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and d must be 1.

2. The denominator d in the output pair (n, d) must always be a positive integer.

3. If the Decimal instance is a finite number, the output pair (n, d) should accurately represent the value of the Decimal instance when evaluated as a float (i.e., n / d should equal the Decimal value).

4. The function should raise an OverflowError if the Decimal instance represents positive or negative infinity.

5. The function should raise a ValueError if the Decimal instance is NaN (not a number).
