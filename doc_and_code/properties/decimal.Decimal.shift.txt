1. The output's sign should be the same as the input's sign, meaning the sign of the first operand remains unchanged after the shift operation.

2. The output should have an exponent that remains the same as the input's exponent, indicating that shifting does not affect the exponent of the first operand.

3. Shifting by zero should return the original operand, confirming that no changes occur when the shift amount is zero.

4. Shifting left (positive integer) should increase the number of digits in the coefficient, while shifting right (negative integer) should decrease the number of digits, except when the result is zero.

5. The output's coefficient should not exceed the defined precision in the context, ensuring that the result adheres to the maximum allowable digits as specified by the context's precision.
