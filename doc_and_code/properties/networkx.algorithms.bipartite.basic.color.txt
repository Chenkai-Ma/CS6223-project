1. The output dictionary should contain exactly two distinct keys representing the two colors, which are 0 and 1.

2. Each node in the input graph must be present in the output dictionary, ensuring that every node has an assigned color.

3. For any two adjacent nodes in the graph, their colors must be different (i.e., if one node is colored 0, its neighbor must be colored 1).

4. The output should raise a `NetworkXError` if the input graph is not bipartite, confirming that the function correctly identifies non-bipartite graphs.

5. Isolated nodes in the graph should be assigned a color of 0 in the output dictionary, ensuring that they are correctly colored as part of the bipartite representation.
