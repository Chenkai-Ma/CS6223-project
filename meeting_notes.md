## Next Steps

### Writing

- (Tentative) DDL: **28 Nov**.
- [@ZX] Two figures (flow chart): one for PBT generation, the other for property coverage.
- Argument: Code distracts/harms LLM to generate PBTs, while doc helps.
- Abstract: add more software testing stuff, e.g., evaluation metrics.
- Introduction: One part for prompting, one part for evaluation metric.
- Method: One part for prompting, one part for evaluation metrics (don't elaborate on prompting details in this part).
- Evaluation: 3 research questions.
- Experiment setup: need some details about models, approaches, and samples (e.g., temprature for decoding).
- RQ1-3: results in tables and analysis.
- Data availability: describe implementation (url to github).
- Conclusion.
- Optional sections: background, threats to validity, related work.

### After Writing

- Send to Manual for feedback. If it is fine, submit in canvas.
