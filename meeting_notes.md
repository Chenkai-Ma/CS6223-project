# Meeting Notes - [2024/10/10]

## Progress

- API [(Google doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ho1ij9dSY98MuzCt7yKXHBuz76prcS5Z1I_kI3RQznE/edit?gid=0#gid=0): 6 out of the 40 are (mostly) self-contained. I managed to find 8 more that are (rather) self-contained.

## Suggestions

- **API**: It seems it is rather impractical to find fully self-contained codes. And it is reasonable to assume LLMs know how to call some basic python functions. So we may **use source codes to complement/enhance documents instead of using source codes independently**. In this case, we expect the source code to have some basic logic, and should be rather simple/short (which leads to 6+11=**17** original APIs, enough for this project.). One potential advantage of this approach is that API docs are often written in the API source codes as comments.
- Experiment: Include a case study to compare our method to CAT.
- Writing: I will start writing no later than 24 Oct.
