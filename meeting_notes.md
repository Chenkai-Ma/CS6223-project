# Meeting Notes - [2024/10/24]

## Progress

- API: collected docs and source codes for 30 APIs (16 from original paper). Docs are stored in folder "api_docs" as .txt files and named according to the url of the API, e.g. "[datetime.date.isocalendar](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.isocalendar)" (this naming is a little different from the original paper), while the content are directly copied from the urls. Codes are stored in folder "api_codes" as .py files and named similarly, and the content are just the one function for the API (no other stuff like imports). Specifically, for each code, I removed the docstring because it is similar to the docs, and we want to separate codes from docs; I also slightly adjusted some identation;
