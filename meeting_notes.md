# Meeting Notes - [2024/10/24]

## Reminders

- Full-scale experiment: it takes two rounds. In the first round, zx generates PBTs and mck filter sound and valid PBTs; in the second round, zx generates mutated test functions from test functions in sound and valid PBTs and mck computes property coverage.
- RQ3 ("docs + codes" vs. "codes only"): details TBD.
- The code (artifact) of this project will also be graded.
