{"function_name": "networkx.algorithms.approximation.clustering_coefficient.average_clustering", "properties": [], "pbt": [], "api_doc": "average_clustering\naverage_clustering(G, trials=1000, seed=None)[source]\nEstimates the average clustering coefficient of G.\n\nThe local clustering of each node in G is the fraction of triangles that actually exist over all possible triangles in its neighborhood. The average clustering coefficient of a graph G is the mean of local clusterings.\n\nThis function finds an approximate average clustering coefficient for G by repeating n times (defined in trials) the following experiment: choose a node at random, choose two of its neighbors at random, and check if they are connected. The approximate coefficient is the fraction of triangles found over the number of trials [1].\n\nParameters\n:\nG\nNetworkX graph\ntrials\ninteger\nNumber of trials to perform (default 1000).\n\nseed\ninteger, random_state, or None (default)\nIndicator of random number generation state.
