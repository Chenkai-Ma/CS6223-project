1. The median of an empty list raises a StatisticsError, indicating that there is no median for the provided data.
2. The median of a single-element list is equal to that element itself.
3. The median of a list with an odd number of elements is the middle element of the sorted list.
4. The median of a list with an even number of elements is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted list.
5. The median is invariant under the order of the input data; that is, sorting the data before finding the median should yield the same result as finding the median directly from the unsorted data.
