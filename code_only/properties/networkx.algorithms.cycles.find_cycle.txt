1. The output cycle must consist of edges that form a closed loop, meaning the last node in the cycle must connect back to the first node in the cycle.

2. If the input graph is acyclic (i.e., it contains no cycles), the output should be an empty list.

3. The length of the output cycle must be greater than or equal to 3 if a cycle is found, as a cycle requires at least three nodes to connect back to the starting node.

4. The output cycle must only include edges that exist in the input graph, ensuring that all edges in the cycle are valid edges of the graph.

5. If the orientation is set to "reverse", the output cycle must reflect the reversed direction of the edges compared to the original graph's edges.
