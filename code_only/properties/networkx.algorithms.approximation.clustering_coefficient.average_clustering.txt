1. The average clustering coefficient should be a non-negative value, as it represents a proportion of triangles formed among the neighbors of nodes in the graph.

2. The average clustering coefficient should be less than or equal to 1, since the maximum possible clustering coefficient occurs when every pair of neighbors is connected, forming a complete subgraph.

3. For an empty graph (with no nodes), the average clustering coefficient should return 0, as there are no triangles to count.

4. The average clustering coefficient should be consistent across multiple trials with the same graph and seed, producing similar average values due to the random sampling process.

5. The average clustering coefficient should be invariant to the order of nodes in the graph; that is, the result should remain the same regardless of how the nodes are arranged or labeled.
