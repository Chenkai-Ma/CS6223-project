1. The output should be a non-negative integer, representing the size of the largest clique in the graph.
2. The output should not exceed the total number of nodes in the graph, as a clique cannot be larger than the number of nodes present.
3. If the graph is empty (contains no nodes), the output should be zero, indicating that there are no cliques.
4. The output should be consistent with the maximum degree of any node in the graph; it cannot be larger than the maximum degree plus one, as cliques are formed by connected nodes.
5. If the graph contains only isolated nodes (nodes with no edges), the output should also be zero, as there are no connections to form a clique.
