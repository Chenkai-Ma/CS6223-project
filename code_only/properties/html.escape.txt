1. The output string should not contain any of the characters `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, or `'` if `quote` is set to `True`.
2. The output string should contain the same number of characters as the input string plus any necessary replacements for special characters.
3. The output string should be a valid HTML-safe representation of the input string, meaning it should not introduce any additional characters outside of the specified replacements.
4. If the input string is empty, the output should also be an empty string regardless of the value of the `quote` parameter.
5. The output should maintain the order of characters from the input string, with only the specified characters being replaced.
