1. The correlation coefficient should always be between -1 and 1, inclusive, regardless of the input values provided.

2. If both input lists are identical, the correlation should be 1, indicating perfect positive correlation.

3. If one of the input lists is constant (all elements are the same), the function should raise a `StatisticsError` indicating that at least one of the inputs is constant.

4. For two input lists where the second list is a linear transformation of the first (e.g., scaled or shifted), the correlation should remain 1 or -1, depending on the direction of the transformation.

5. The correlation should be invariant under permutations of the input lists, meaning that changing the order of elements in either input list should not affect the calculated correlation coefficient.
