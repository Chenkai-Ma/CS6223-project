1. The output of the median() function should always lie within the range of the input data. For any given list of numbers, the median should not be less than the smallest number or greater than the largest number in the list.

2. The output of median() for a list of numbers that are all the same should be equal to any number in the list. For instance, median([5,5,5,5,5]) should return 5.

3. If the list of numbers is even and the two middle numbers are the same, the resulting median should be equal to those middle numbers. For example, with the list [2,4,4,5], the median should also be 4.

4. If the list of numbers is odd, the output should be equal to the middle number. For instance, with the list [1,3,5,7,9], the median should be 5.

5. If the list of numbers is even and the two middle numbers are different, the median should be the average of those two numbers. For instance, if the list is [1,2,3,4], the output should be 2.5.
