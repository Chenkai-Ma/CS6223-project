1. The output node is an ancestor to both input nodes: Check that, in the directed graph, there exists a directed path from the output node to each of the input nodes. This can be verified by checking if the output node is inside the ancestors of each input nodes.

2. Liveness property: The function always responds with a node or default if there is no common ancestor between the two input nodes - no deadlock or infinite waiting.

3. Output should be the lowest common ancestor: There should not be any other common ancestor of the input nodes that could be reached by a directed path from the output node.

4. Default property: If no common ancestor exists, the function should return the 'default' value. If no default is provided, Python's None should be returned.

5. Consistent output: For any repeated function calls with the same graph and the same pair of nodes, the output must be consistent - the same lowest common ancestor should be returned.
