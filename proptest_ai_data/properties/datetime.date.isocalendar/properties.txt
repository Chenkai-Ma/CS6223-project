1. The output of the function should be an instance of the IsoCalendarDate named tuple. This can be tested using isinstance to ensure type safety.

2. The year component of the output tuple should fall within a realistic range (e.g., 1 to 9999 which are the valid years in Python's datetime module). 

3. The week component of the return value should always be an integer between 1 and 53, inclusive.

4. The weekday component of the return value should always be an integer in the range 1 to 7, inclusive. 

5. The relationships between the year, week and weekday components should be consistent with the ISO calendar logic. For example, if the date is January 1st but the weekday is 5 (Friday), the year should be the next calendar year if January 1st is part of Week 1 of the next year according to ISO calendar rules.
