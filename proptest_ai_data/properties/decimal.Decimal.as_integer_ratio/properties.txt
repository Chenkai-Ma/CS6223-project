1. The output of as_integer_ratio() should always be a tuple with two elements. 

2. Both elements in the tuple should be integers.

3. If the Decimal instance is a positive number, then both the numerator (n) and the denominator (d) of the returned fraction should be positive. If the Decimal instance is a negative number, then the numerator should be negative, and the denominator should be positive.

4. The result should represent the original Decimal instance in lowest terms, meaning that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator should be 1.

5. If the Decimal instance represents a regular finite decimal, as_integer_ratio() should not throw an error. If the instance represents an infinity, then an OverflowError should be thrown. If it represents an NaN, then ValueError should be thrown.
