1. Degree Type: The output degree value(s) should always be integers. This is because the degree of a node in a graph is the number of edges tied to that node (either incoming or outgoing) - which can only be an integer.

2. Output Length: In cases where the function is used without specifying any node ('nbunch' argument is None), the degree function's output should equal to the total number of nodes in the graph G.

3. Degree Range: The returned degree value of any node should be in the range of [0, n-1], with n being the total number of nodes in the graph G. This property also assumes that the graph doesn't contain any self-loop (an edge that directly connects a node to itself).

4. Degree of a single node: If a single node is sent as the argument, the function should return an integer rather than a dictionary, indicating the degree of the specified node in graph G.

5. Weighted Degree: If the 'weight' parameter is set to some attribute (like 'length' for edge lengths), the returned degree should account for these weights. In this scenario, the calculated degree can be a float number. This property assumes that the graph G is a weighted one.
