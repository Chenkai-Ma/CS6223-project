1. The output of statistics.mean should always be a numeric (float, Fraction, or Decimal) value, given that the input is a sequence or iterable of numeric data.
   
2. Given a constant sequence or iterable (all elements are the same), the output of statistics.mean should be equal to any element of that sequence or iterable.

3. If the data includes negative and positive values such that their total sum is zero, for example, [-3, -2, 2, 3], the output of the function must be 0.
   
4. For a list with a single element, the mean should be equal to that element itself.
   
5. The mean of the reverse of a sequence or an iterable should be the same as the mean of the original sequence or iterable.
