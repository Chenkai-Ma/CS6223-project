1. The datatype of the returned array should be the same as specified in the dtype parameter. If dtype is not specified, it should default to the dtype of array a or the default platform integer if a has an integer dtype with lower precision.
2. If an 'out' ndarray is specified, the output should be the reference to this 'out' ndarray, after getting filled with cumulative sum. If not specified, a new array should be created for the output.
3. The size of the output array should be the same as that of the input array i.e., the length of the input list equals the length of the output list.
4. If an axis is specified, the output array should have the same shape as the input array. If not, the output array will take the shape of a flattened input array. 
5. If the input array elements are of floating point type, cumsum(a)[-1] (the last value of the cumsum array) may not equal sum(a) because of possible rounding errors in floating point arithmetic. In other words, the commutativity of floating-point addition is not guaranteed.
