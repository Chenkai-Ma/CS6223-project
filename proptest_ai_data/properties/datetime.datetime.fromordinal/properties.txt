1. The output should be a datetime.datetime object.
2. The output's ordinal number (obtained through toordinal() method) should always be equal to the ordinal input.
3. The output's hour, minute, second, and microsecond properties should all be 0 as the documentation states.
4. The output's tzinfo property should always be None as the method does not deal with timezone information.
5. The output should be within the valid date range in the Gregorian calendar. In other words, datetime.MINYEAR <= output.year <= datetime.MAXYEAR.
