Based on the pandas.isna() API documentation, here are five properties that can be used for property-based testing:

1. The function should always return a boolean or array-like object of booleans. The type of the output entirely depends on the input type. For scalar input, the output should always be a scalar boolean. For array-like input, the output should always be an array-like boolean.
  
2. The return value should be True for NaN value in the Numeric arrays and None or NaN in the object arrays or NaT in the datetime arrays. For instance, pd.isna(np.nan) should return True.
  
3. For non-null values or non-NaN values in an array or a scalar value, the function should always return false. For example, pd.isna('dog') should return False.
   
4. For input types like Series, DataFrame, and Indices, the returned type should still be of the same type, having boolean values indicating whether respective elements are missing or not. For instance, for a DataFrame input, the returned output should be a DataFrame of booleans.

5. The function should be able to handle and process inputs of various data types (scalar, array-like objects, pandas' Series, DataFrame, Indices) and return the expected output. For example, for ndarray inputs, it should return an ndarray of booleans. 

It's essential to note that these testing properties are under the assumption that the pandas.isna() function should always return the correct missing value indications as per its documented behavior.
