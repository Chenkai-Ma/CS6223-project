zlib.compress(data, /, level=- 1, wbits=MAX_WBITS)
Compresses the bytes in data, returning a bytes object containing compressed data. level is an integer from 0 to 9 or -1 controlling the level of compression; 1 (Z_BEST_SPEED) is fastest and produces the least compression, 9 (Z_BEST_COMPRESSION) is slowest and produces the most. 0 (Z_NO_COMPRESSION) is no compression. The default value is -1 (Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION). Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION represents a default compromise between speed and compression (currently equivalent to level 6).

The wbits argument controls the size of the history buffer (or the “window size”) used when compressing data, and whether a header and trailer is included in the output. It can take several ranges of values, defaulting to 15 (MAX_WBITS):

+9 to +15: The base-two logarithm of the window size, which therefore ranges between 512 and 32768. Larger values produce better compression at the expense of greater memory usage. The resulting output will include a zlib-specific header and trailer.

−9 to −15: Uses the absolute value of wbits as the window size logarithm, while producing a raw output stream with no header or trailing checksum.

+25 to +31 = 16 + (9 to 15): Uses the low 4 bits of the value as the window size logarithm, while including a basic gzip header and trailing checksum in the output.

Raises the error exception if any error occurs.

Changed in version 3.6: level can now be used as a keyword parameter.

Changed in version 3.11: The wbits parameter is now available to set window bits and compression type.
