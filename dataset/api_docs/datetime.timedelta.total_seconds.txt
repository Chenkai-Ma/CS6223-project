timedelta.total_seconds()
Return the total number of seconds contained in the duration. Equivalent to td / timedelta(seconds=1). For interval units other than seconds, use the division form directly (e.g. td / timedelta(microseconds=1)).

Note that for very large time intervals (greater than 270 years on most platforms) this method will lose microsecond accuracy.

Added in version 3.2.

Examples of usage: timedelta
An additional example of normalization:

>>>
# Components of another_year add up to exactly 365 days
from datetime import timedelta
year = timedelta(days=365)
another_year = timedelta(weeks=40, days=84, hours=23,
                         minutes=50, seconds=600)
year == another_year
True
year.total_seconds()
