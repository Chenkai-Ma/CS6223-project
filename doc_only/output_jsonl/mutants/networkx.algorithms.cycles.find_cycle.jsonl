The edges in the output must form a valid cycle, meaning the last node of the last edge must connect back to the first node of the first edge.", "3. For directed graphs, if the orientation is set to 'original', the output edges must respect the original direction of the edges in the graph.", "4. If the orientation is set to 'ignore', the output edges must not respect the direction of the edges, and the traversal should treat all edges as undirected.", "5. The output must include directional information (either 'forward' or 'reverse') for each edge if the orientation is specified as 'original', 'reverse', or 'ignore'."]}
