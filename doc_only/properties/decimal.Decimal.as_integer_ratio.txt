1. The output pair (n, d) must consist of two integers, where n is the numerator and d is the denominator.

2. The denominator d must always be positive, regardless of the input Decimal value.

3. The fraction represented by the output pair (n, d) must be in lowest terms, meaning that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and d must be 1.

4. If the input Decimal is a finite number, the output pair (n, d) must represent the exact value of the Decimal as a fraction.

5. The function must raise an OverflowError if the input Decimal is an infinity and a ValueError if the input is NaN (not a number).
