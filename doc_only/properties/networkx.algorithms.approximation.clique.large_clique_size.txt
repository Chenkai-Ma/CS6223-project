1. The output size of the large clique must be a non-negative integer, as it represents the number of nodes in the clique.

2. The output size of the large clique must not exceed the total number of nodes in the input graph \( G \).

3. If the input graph \( G \) is empty (i.e., has no nodes), the output should be zero, indicating that there are no cliques.

4. The output size of the large clique must be less than or equal to the maximum degree of the graph plus one, as this is a theoretical upper bound on the size of a clique.

5. If the input graph \( G \) is disconnected (i.e., contains multiple components), the output size should reflect the largest clique found in any of the connected components of the graph.
