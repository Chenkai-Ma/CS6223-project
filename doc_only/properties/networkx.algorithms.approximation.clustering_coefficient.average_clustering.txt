1. The output average clustering coefficient should always be a float value between 0 and 1, inclusive, as it represents a proportion of triangles in the graph.

2. If the input graph \( G \) has no edges, the output should be 0, as there are no triangles to form.

3. The output should remain consistent for the same input graph \( G \) when the number of trials is sufficiently large, indicating that the approximation converges to a stable value.

4. If the input graph \( G \) is empty (i.e., has no nodes), the output should be 0, as there are no local clusterings to compute.

5. The output should vary with changes in the structure of the input graph \( G \); specifically, adding edges should not decrease the average clustering coefficient, and removing edges should not increase it.
