1. The output correlation coefficient must always be a floating-point number between -1 and +1, inclusive.

2. If both input lists are identical (and not constant), the output correlation coefficient must be 1.0, indicating a perfect positive correlation.

3. If one of the input lists is constant (e.g., all elements are the same), the function should raise a StatisticsError.

4. If the method is set to 'ranked', the output correlation coefficient must reflect the strength of a monotonic relationship, and it should be equal to 1.0 if the ranks of the two inputs are perfectly aligned.

5. The output correlation coefficient must remain consistent (i.e., produce the same value) for the same pair of input lists across multiple calls, regardless of any additional factors.
