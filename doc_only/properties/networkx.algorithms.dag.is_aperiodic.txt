1. If the input graph is acyclic, the output should always be False, as acyclic graphs do not contain cycles and therefore cannot be aperiodic.

2. If the input graph contains a single cycle of length k, where k > 1, the output should be False, since k divides the length of the cycle.

3. If the input graph contains multiple cycles with lengths that are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), the output should be True, indicating that the graph is aperiodic.

4. If the input graph contains cycles where all cycle lengths share a common divisor greater than 1, the output should be False, as this indicates the presence of a common k that divides each cycle length.

5. The output of the function should remain consistent regardless of the order of edges in the input directed graph, meaning that the function should yield the same result for any permutation of the edges that define the same graph structure.
