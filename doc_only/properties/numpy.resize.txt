1. The total number of elements in the output array must equal the product of the dimensions specified in `new_shape`, regardless of the input array's size.

2. If the `new_shape` specifies a size larger than the original array, the output array should contain repeated copies of the original array's elements, filling the additional space as necessary.

3. The output array must maintain the same data type as the input array.

4. The output array should be filled with elements in C-order, meaning that the elements are filled row-wise from the original array.

5. If the `new_shape` specifies a size smaller than the original array, the output array should contain only the first elements of the original array, truncated to fit the new size.
